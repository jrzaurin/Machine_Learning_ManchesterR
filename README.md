#Machine Learning in R: Supervised Classificiation
##Scripts relating to talk at [Manchester R user group](http://www.rmanchester.org/) 
###29/02/2016

These scripts demonstrate (very simply), how to use three useful machine learning algorithims in R to do supervised classifciation. They are:
* The Elastic Net using the [glmnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html) package
* Gradient Boosting using the [xgboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/index.html) package
* Deep Learning Neural Networks using the [H2o](https://cran.r-project.org/package=h2o) package
